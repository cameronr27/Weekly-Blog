<h1>This week we learned about bout Docker, a cloud based repository and its practical use of handling containers. Docker allows the users to 
push and pull containers efficiently. We had to create a user account to take advantage of the docker services, I never had one so 
I had to create one. Once account creation was finished our class quickly went over how use docker and what its functions are over a web conference.
To start an interactive docker terminal I have to use the command docker run -it, I had to get familiar with the new flags. We were also
taught that docker installs barebone iso files, this means we have to install any packages that we need before we can even use Docker
efficiently. I had to familiarize myself with commands with online documentation after learning how the syntax worked in class, specifying
a docker container was giving me issues because of all the different flags, for an example: docker run -it cit481 centos /bin/bash looked
confusing at first. I now know that cit481 is the tag and centOS being the actual VM when typing that syntax.</h1>
